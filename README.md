# If you don't know…

To download a theme, choose the theme file and click "Raw" at the file top. Use Ctrl + S to save. You must save in the following path: `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\themes` (or `\plugins` for plugins) (paste it in file explorer) (for Windows). Make sure your file name ends with `.theme.css` (`.plugin.js` for plugins, `.config.json` is the plugin's data) and enable in Discord app.
