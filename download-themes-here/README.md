## Featured: Discord AMOLED dark theme

I tried to copy the original Discord AMOLED dark theme on mobile to use it on PC. There are 2 versions of Discord AMOLED:
- [Normal version](https://github.com/YTGamer/bdthemes/blob/master/download-themes-here/DiscordAmoled.theme.css)
- [Colors optimized for PC](https://github.com/YTGamer/bdthemes/blob/master/download-themes-here/DiscordAmoledOptimized.theme.css)

### Mobile version:

Notify the support if you have found differences (colors, etcâ€¦). Do not report something that is on the mobile or PC version, but that is not on the other version.

## [ContextMenus Old Style](https://github.com/YTGamer/bdthemes/blob/master/download-themes-here/ContextMenusOldStyle.theme.css)

Like me, you don't like the new style that changed hover to blurple? This theme allows you to go back to the older hover colors!

Please note that is not exactly the same than the official old version, it only changes the colors and will not broke any plugins.

## [Custom Font](https://github.com/YTGamer/bdthemes/blob/master/download-themes-here/CustomFont.theme.css)

**This theme allows you to use your own fonts** (installed in your computer) **in Discord!** Supports global font and codeblocks font. You can also remember your fonts by using remember variables. I recommend you to download the plugin Theme Settings to change easier this theme's variables. [Click here to download!

## [BandagedBD Light Theme Fixer](https://github.com/YTGamer/bdthemes/blob/master/download-themes-here/BBDLightThemeFixer.theme.css)

If you are using light theme with BandagedBD `v0.3`, this theme is useful to fix dark-optimized classes. Tip: You can enable it using dark theme, it will haves no effect until you switch to light theme. (do not use this fixer on browser or another client that hasn't BBD installed, it will does absolutely nothing)
