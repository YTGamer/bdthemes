## Discord AMOLED dark theme

I tried to copy the original Discord AMOLED dark theme on mobile to use it on PC.

Notify the support if you have found differences (colors, etcâ€¦). Do not report something that is on the mobile or PC version, but that is not on the other version.

## Remove Nitro Tab

This *theme* (or plugin lol) allows you to hide the Nitro Tab.

## Custom Font

**This theme allows you to use your own fonts** (installed in your computer) **in Discord!** Supports global font and codeblocks font. You can also remember your fonts by using remember variables. I recommend you to download the plugin Theme Settings to change easier this theme's variables. [Click here to download!
