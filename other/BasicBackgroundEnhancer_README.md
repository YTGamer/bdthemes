# How to use [BasicBackgroundEnhancer](https://github.com/YTGamer/bdthemes/tree/master/other)?

In your BasicBackground file, paste this:
```css
@import url(https://ytgamer.github.io/bdthemes/other/BasicBackgroundEnhancer.css);
```
…just after the previous `@import url(…);`.

## ⚠ PLEASE NOTE BEFORE USING

This is **unofficial**!

- The original [BasicBackground](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/BasicBackground) is **not** made by me, but by DevilBro;
- But BBE¹ is made by me (YTGamer).
- So, remember that BBE is just a theme enhancer for BB² to add compatibility with [Modernizer](https://github.com/YTGamer/bdthemes/blob/master/nifn/Modernizer.css) (another theme made by me) and more style.
- If DevilBro wants me to delete this enhancer, I'll delete it and keep this only for me. I respect his work, and thanks to him to make all of his themes and plugins.
